
- Compute the difference image between the original and the predicted images to see the effect of the prediction methods.
- Compute the PSNR values for the two different prediction functions and compare them.
- Check the resulting prediction quality subjectively and describe and explain the differences between the two methods.
- Change the input YUV file from 'Dancer_1920x1088.yuv' to 'Dancer_Depth_1920x1088.yuv' and re-evaluate the whole process with this special signal.
